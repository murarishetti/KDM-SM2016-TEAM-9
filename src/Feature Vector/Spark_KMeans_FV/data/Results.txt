faq last update Sun Mar ABOUT THIS post this be a still rather rough listing of likely question and information about RIPEM a program for public key mail encryption it this faq not RIPEM be write and will be maintain by Marc VanHeyningen mvanheyn whale c indiana edu it will be post to a variety of newsgroup on a monthly basis follow up discussion specific to RIPEM be redirect to the group alt security ripem this month I have reformat this post in a attempt to comply with the standard for hypertext faq formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World wide web let I know what you think DISCLAIMER nothing in this faq should be consider legal advice or anything other than one person s opinion if you want real legal advice talk to a real lawyer question and answer what be RIPEM RIPEM be a program which perform Privacy enhance Mail PEM use the cryptographic technique of rsa and DES it allow you electronic mail to have the property of authentication i e who send it can be confirm and privacy i e nobody can read it except the intended recipient ripem be write primarily by Mark Riordan mrr scss cl msu edu most of the code be in the public domain except for the rsa routine which be a library call RSAREF license from RSA Data Security Inc how can I get ripem ripem contain the library of cryptographic routine rsaref which be consider munitions and thus be export restricted from distribution to people who be not citizen or permanent resident of the U S or Canada therefore the follow request be quote from the README file please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or Canada this be a personal request from I the author of ripem and a condition of you use of RIPEM note that rsaref be not in the public domain and a license for it be include with the distribution you should read it before use RIPEM the best way to get it be to ask a friend for a copy since this will reduce the load on those site that do carry it not to mention the human that run they naturally this require that you trust the friend ripem be available via anonymous ftp to citizen and permanent resident in the U S from rsa com cd to rsaref and read the README file for info last I look this site contain only the source tree and do not contain compile binary or the nice Mac version ripem as well as some other crypt stuff have its home site on rpub cl msu edu which be open to non anonymous ftp for user in the U S and Canada who be citizen or permanent resident to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub crypt and read the file get access for convenience binary for many architecture be available here in addition to the full source tree will ripem run on my machine probably it have already be port to ms dos and most flavor of Unix SunOS NeXT Linux AIX ULTRIX Solaris etc port to Macintosh include a standard UNIX style port and a rather nice Mac like port write by Raymond Lau author of StuffIt more port be expect and help of user be invite will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface be will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the user guide include with the distribution discuss way to use ripem with many popular mailer include Berkeley mush Elm and MH Code be also include in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside GNU Emacs if you make a new interface for ripem or create a improvement on one in the distribution which you believe be convenient to use secure and may be useful to other feel free to post it to alt security ripem what be RSA RSA be a crypto system which be asymmetric or public key this mean that there be two different related key one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one can not reasonably be derive from the other you may publish you encryption or public key widely and keep you decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use you public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key need to decrypt it note that the message send with rsa be normally just the DES key to the real message see what be DES note that the above only provide for privacy for authentication the fingerprint of the message see what be a fingerprint like md be encrypt with the sender be private key the recipient can use the sender be public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender rsa be name for the three man Rivest Shamir and Adleman who invent it to find out more about rsa ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq or look in sci crypt what be DES DES be the Data Encryption Standard a widely use symmetric or secret key crypto system unlike RSA DES use the same key to encrypt and decrypt message however DES be much faster than rsa ripem use both DES and RSA it generate a random key and encrypt you mail with DES use that key it then encrypt that key with the recipient s public rsa key and include the result in the letter allow the recipient to recover the DES key DES be sometimes consider weak because it be somewhat old and use a key length consider too short by modern standard however it should be reasonably safe against a opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it be not unlikely that future ripem will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by use multiple encryption with DES what be PEM and how do RIPEM relate pem be Privacy enhance Mail a system for allow easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail it be describe in rfc these document have be approve and obsolete the old rfc ripem be not really a complete implementation of pem because PEM specify certificate for authenticate key which RIPEM do not handle at this time they addition be plan what be this about distribute and authenticate key for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know you public key for you to be able to confirm that the message receive come from she you must know she public key it be important that this information be accurate if a bad guy convince she that he key be in fact yours she will send message which he can read RIPEM allow for three method of key management a central server the distribute finger server and a flat file all three be describe in the RIPEM user guide which be part of the distribution none of they provide perfect security why do all ripem public key look very similar RIPEM public key begin with a pkcs identifier describe various characteristic about the key so the first bunch of character in you key may be the same as those of lot of other people be key this do not mean you key be similar but only that they be the same class of key be generate with the same program be of the same length etc what be a fingerprint like md md be a message digest algorithm produce by RSA Data Security Inc it provide a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it be cryptographically secure because it be not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produce the same fingerprint thus instead of sign the entire message with the sender be private key only the md of the message need to be sign for authentication md be sometimes use for other purpose for example it be often use to map a input of arbitrary length to bit of datum as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md be describe in its entirety include a implementation in c in RFC what be PGP PGP be another cryptographic mail program call Pretty Good Privacy PGP have be around longer than RIPEM and work somewhat differently PGP be not compatible with ripem in any way though PGP do also use RSA some major difference between PGP and RIPEM PGP have more key management feature particularly for user without a direct network connection ripem conform to the PEM rfc and thus have a greater probability of work with other pem software pgp make no attempt to be compatible with anything other than PGP in fact pgp be not compatible with pgp ripem use rsaref a library of rsa routine from RSA Data Security Inc rsaref come with a license which allow noncommercial use PGP use its own implementation of rsa which be not licensed thus PKP the firm hold the U S patent on the RSA algorithm claim that it be a infringement of that patent to make use or sell PGP in the U S or Canada in acknowledgement of this pgp be original author Phil Zimmermann say in the documentation in fact if you live in the USA and you be not a federal agency you shouldn t actually run pgp on you computer because Public Key Partners want to forbid you from run my software pgp be contraband both pgp and ripem be export restricted and can not be send outside the U S and Canada however PGP already exist on many ftp site in Europe and other place whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever the documentation to PGP be recommend read to anyone interested in such issue note that the above fact both regard patent and export restriction be somewhat controversial many people think it shouldn t be that way and some people interpret various document differently unfortunately discussion of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in misc legal computing see DISCLAIMER what about RPEM RPEM stand for Rabin Privacy enhance Mail it be similar to ripem but use a public key cipher invent by rabin which be not rsa in a attempt to avoid the patent on RSA it be write by Mark Riordan the same author as RIPEM its distribution be halt when contrary to the belief of many include Rabin Public Key Partners PKP claim that they patent be broad enough to cover any public key cipher whose strength rest in the difficulty of factoring product of large prime not just RSA this claim be not universally accept by any means but be not challenge for pragmatic reason RPEM be not really use anymore it be not compatible with ripem or PGP what be MIME MIME stand for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions and be describe in RFC you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime how PEM should interact with mime be not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of have a mime type application x ripem in order to send ripem message as MIME one I hope some standard will emerge Draft Internet document exist on the matter I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM you may wish to check the companion post ripem attack which discuss some of the more obvious attack on ripem s security and what procedure will minimize the risk ripem be main weak area be probably key distribution

Standard a widely use symmetric or secret key crypto system unlike RSA DES use the same key to encrypt and decrypt message however DES be much faster than rsa ripem use both DES and RSA it generate a random key and encrypt you mail with DES use that key it then encrypt that key with the recipient s public rsa key and include the result in the letter allow the recipient to recover the DES key DES be sometimes consider weak because it be somewhat old and use a key length consider too short by modern standard however it should be reasonably safe against a opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it be not likely that the PEM standard will incorporate support for other symmetric cipher in the near future because there be a strong feeling that PEM should be stable so it can become utilize widely without early problem with interoperability what be a fingerprint like md md be a message digest algorithm produce by RSA Data Security Inc it provide a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it be cryptographically secure because it be not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produce the same fingerprint thus instead of sign the entire message with the sender be private key only the md of the message need to be sign for authentication md s can also be exchange directly for authentication for example RIPEM public key include a md of the public key in the file so party wish to confirm they key be authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange md s of key and verify they accuracy md be sometimes use for other purpose for example it be often use to map a input of arbitrary length to bit of datum as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md be describe in its entirety include a implementation in c in RFC there have be some recent suggestion that md may not be as strong a hash as be originally believe presumably some other hash function will be use if this be accept as true what be PEM PEM be Privacy enhance Mail a standard for allow transfer of encrypted electronic mail generate over a long period of time by a work group of expert it be describe in rfc these document have be approve and obsolete the old rfc ripem be not really a complete implementation of pem because PEM specify certificate for authenticate key which RIPEM do not handle at this time they addition be plan what be this about distribute and authenticate key for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know you public key for you to be able to confirm that the message receive come from she you must know she public key it be important that this information be accurate if a bad guy convince she that he key be in fact yours she will send message which he can read RIPEM allow for three method of key management a central server the distribute finger server and a flat file all three be describe in the RIPEM user guide which be part of the distribution none of they provide perfect security the PEM standard call for key management by certificate the addition of this feature to RIPEM be plan but chicken egg issue still exist isn t it a bad idea to use patented algorithm in standard like PEM this issue have be consider in the standard process RFC the specification for internet standard have a discussion section on what specification for nondiscriminatory availability must be meet for a patented method to be include in a standard RFC address this issue with regard to the patent cover public key cryptography this do not of course mean that all question be settle or that everyone be in agreement a interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithm in standard with regard to public key cryptography be in the League for Programming Freedom archive available via ftp ftp uu net doc lpf in the file bidzo letter and bidzos response amusingly the lpf file on ftp uu net be compress with a patented algorithm what about RSADSI PKP RSA Data Security Inc RSADSI be a California base company specialize in cryptographic technology public Key Partners be a firm which hold exclusive sub licensing rights of the follow U S patent and all of they corresponding foreign patent cryptographic apparatus and Method Diffie Hellman No Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus and Method Hellman Merkle No Cryptographic Communications System and Method RSA No Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus and Method Hellman Pohlig No pkp claim these four patent cover all know method of public key cryptography the two business be rather closely related for example the same person Jim Bidzos be president of both of they PKP have license this technology to a considerable number of company IBM DEC Motorola at t Lotus for use in they product PKP have also threaten and file lawsuit defend they patent RIPEM be originally create with no connection to RSADSI other than its use of the rsaref library and for no reason other than its author be desire to see widespread use of public key cryptography however after the ball start roll people at RSADSI get interested RSADSI decide to carry RIPEM on its ftp site and some people there start make they own RIPEM key and contribute code ripem even win the best application build on rsaref in award why do all ripem public key look very similar RIPEM public key begin with a PKCS Public Key Cryptography Standards identifier describe various characteristic about the key so the first bunch of character in you key may be the same as those of lot of other people be key this do not mean you key be similar but only that they be the same class of key be generate with the same program be of the same length etc what be PGP PGP be another cryptographic mail program call Pretty Good Privacy PGP have be around longer than RIPEM and work somewhat differently PGP be not compatible with ripem in any way though PGP do also use RSA a few major difference between PGP and RIPEM PGP have more key management feature particularly for user without a direct network connection ripem conform to the PEM rfc and thus have a greater probability of work with other pem software pgp make no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself RIPEM use RSAREF a library of rsa routine from rsadsi which come with a license allow noncommercial use PGP use its own implementation of RSA PKP claim that it be a violation of its patent to make use or sell PGP in the U S or Canada without either a license or write permission see DISCLAIMER see what about RSADSI PKP Phil Zimmermann the author of PGP stop distribute it after be threaten with legal action he believe that a licensing scheme could be arrange but it hasn t happen and there seem little prospect of it happen in the future he acknowledge in the PGP user be Guide in fact if you live in the USA and you be not a federal agency you shouldn t actually run pgp on you computer because Public Key Partners want to forbid you from run my software pgp be contraband both pgp and ripem be export restricted and can not be send outside the U S and Canada without a export license however PGP already exist on many ftp site in Europe and other place whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever the documentation to PGP be recommend read to anyone interested in such issue unfortunately it be not distribute separately from the program which can be difficult to find in the U s on ftp site due to liability concern what about rpem rpem stand for Rabin Privacy enhance Mail it be similar to ripem but use a public key cipher invent by rabin which be not rsa in a attempt to avoid the patent on public key system it be write by Mark Riordan who later write RIPEM its distribution be halt when contrary to the belief of many include Rabin PKP claim that they patent be broad enough to cover the cipher employ this claim be not universally accept but be not challenge for pragmatic reason RPEM be not really use anymore it be not compatible with ripem or PGP what be MIME MIME stand for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions and be describe in RFC you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime a faq exist on it how PEM should interact with mime be not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of have a mime type application x ripem in order to send ripem message as MIME one I hope some standard will emerge Draft Internet document exist on the matter what be TIS PEM trust Information Systems be work on a version of Privacy enhance Mail for general availability last I hear it be rumor to be integrate into a existing mail user agent mh rather than a stand alone system and in beta test I don t know much more than that I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM you may wish to check the companion post ripem attack which discuss some of the more obvious attack on ripem s security and what procedure will minimize the risk ripem be main weak area be probably key distribution

Mar SOME possible attacks on RIPEM this be a living list of potential weakness to keep you eye open for when use RIPEM for secure electronic mail it do not go into great detail and be almost certainly not exhaustive obviously many of the weakness be weakness of cryptographically secure mail in general and will pertain to secure mail program other than ripem it be maintain by Marc VanHeyningen mvanheyn c indiana edu it be post monthly to a variety of news group followup pertain specifically to RIPEM should go to alt security ripem CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS break rsa would allow a attacker to find out you private key in which case he could read any mail encrypt to you and sign message with you private key rsa be generally believe to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic technique even a standard key about bit with ripem be long enough to render this impractical bar a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factor break DES would allow a attacker to read any give message since the message itself be encrypt with DES it would not allow a attacker to claim to be you DES have only bit in its key and thus could conceivably be compromise by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agency have such money to devote to simply read one message since each message have a different DES key the work for each message would remain high KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS steal you private key would allow the same benefit as break RSA to safeguard it it be encrypt with a DES key which be derive from a passphrase you type in however if a attacker can get a copy of you private keyfile and you passphrase by snoop network packet tap line or whatever he could break the whole scheme the main risk be that of transfer either the passphrase or the private key file across a untrusted link so don t do that Run RIPEM on a trust machine preferably one sit right in front of you ideally you own machine in you own home or maybe office which nobody else have physical access to fooling you into accept a bogus public key for someone else could allow a opponent to deceive you into send secret message to he rather than to the real recipient if the enemy can fool you intended recipient as well he could be encrypt the message with the other bogus public key and pass they along it be important to get the proper public key of other people the most common mechanism for this be finger assume the opponent have not compromise router or daemon or such finger can be give a fair amount of trust the strongest method of key authentication be to exchange key in person however this be not always practical have other people vouch for you by sign a statement contain you key be possible although ripem doesn t have feature for do this as automatically as PGP RIPEM do generate and check md fingerprint of public key in the key file they may be exchange via a separate channel for authentication PLAYBACK ATTACKS even if a opponent can not break the cryptography a opponent could still cause difficulty for example suppose you send a message with mic only a pem mode which do not provide disclosure protection to Alice which say ok let s do that you opponent intercept it and now resend it to Bob who now have a message which be authenticate as from you tell he to do that of course he may interpret it in a entirely different context or you opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later figure it would be see differently at a later time or the opponent could change the Originator name to himself register you public key as he and send a message hope the recipient will send he return mail indicate perhaps even quote the unknown message to defeat playback attack the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique identifier typically the date a good front end script for ripem should do this automatically IMHO as a recipient you should be sure that the Originator name header and the sender indicate within the plaintext be the same that you really be a recipient and that the message be not a old one some this also can and should be automate the author of this faq have make a modest attempt at automate the process of generate and check encapsulated header the program be include in the standard distribution in the util directory LOCAL ATTACKS clearly the security of RIPEM can not be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption be perform for example under UNIX a super user could manage to get at you encrypted mail although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext depend how it be store in addition the link between you and the machine run ripem be a extension of that if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine which you be connect to via network or worse yet modem a eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also you passphrase ripem should only be execute on system you trust obviously in the extreme case ripem should only be use on you own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else have access to which have only carefully examine software know to be free of virus and so on however there be a very real trade off between convenience and security here a more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security by keep private key and the statically link of course executable on a floppy disk some people will keep ripem on a multi user system but when dial in over a insecure line they will download the message to they own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there however the security provide by such a mechanism be somewhat illusory since you presumably type you cleartext password to log in you have just give away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and install trap in you account to steal you private key next time you use it from a less insecure line this will likely remain the situation as long as most system use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my security arrangement in my plan next to my public key so that potential correspondent can be aware what level of precaution be in place some people use two key a short one which be not carefully manage for ordinary use and a longer one which be treat with greater care for critical correspondence UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS RIPEM be encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key correspond to the public key use to encrypt the datum may read the traffic however once someone with that key get the message she may always make whatever kind of transformation she wish there exist no cryptographic barrier to a recipient say take a encrypted message and convert it to a MIC only message sign by you and readable by anyone although ripem do not provide this functionality indeed the latest pem draft I have see specifically state that such transformation should be possible to allow forwarding function to work include the recipient in the plaintext as mention above will make it possible for recipient of a redistributed message to be aware of its original nature naturally the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people use it

write another uncommon problem be maternal hemorrhage I don t remember the incidence but it be something like in or birth it be hard to see how you could handle it at home and you wouldn t have very much time thing you might consider be that people be risk tradeoff vary I consider a risk of loss of a love one to require considerable effort in the avoid Mark you seem to be terrify of the birth process that be ridiculous and unable to believe that woman s body be actually design to do it they aren t design they evolve and much as it discomfort we in human a trouble free birth process be sacrifice to increase brain and cranial size Wild animal have a much easier time with birth than human do domestic horse and cow typically have a worse time to give you a idea my family tree be complicate because a few of my pioneer great great grandfather have several wife and we never could figure out which wife have each child one might ask why this happen my great great grandfather be by the time they reach they forty quite prosperous farmer nonetheless they lose several wife each to the rigor of childbirth the graveyard in Spencer Indiana and Boswell North Dakota contain quite a few gravestone like Ida wf of Jacob Liptrap and baby may you want to section all woman carry breech in case one in a hundred or a thousand breech baby get hang up in second stage more like one in ten and the consequence can be devastate I have direct experience of more than a dozen victim of a foul up breech birth and now you want all baby bear in hospital base on a guess of how likely maternal hemorrhage be and a false belief that it be fatal it isn t always fatal but it be often fatal when it happen out of reach of adequate help more often it permanently damage one s health clearly woman s body evolve to give birth I be no believer in divine design however evolution do not favor trouble free birth for human you have you kid where you want you encourage you wife to get six inch hole cut through she stomach muscle expose herself to anesthesia and infection and whatever other just in case measure you think be necessary my aren t we wroth I haven t read a more outrageous straw man attack in month I can practically see you mouth foam we be statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risk although I can t produce exact statistics year after the last time we look they up rest assure that we balance c section risk against other risk I wouldn t encourage my wife to have a caesarean unless it be clearly indicate on the other hand I be oppose on obvious grounds to wait until a emergency to give in and bear this in mind my wife take the lead in all of these decision we talk thing over and I do a lot of the leg work but the main decision be really hers but I for one be bother by you continued suggestion especially to the misc kidder pregnant for the first time that birth be dangerous even fatal and that all these unpleasant thing be far better than the risk you run just do it naturally I don t know of very many home birth advocate even that think that a first time mother should have she baby at home I m no luddite I have have a section I m plan a hospital birth this time but for heaven s sake not everyone need that but people should bother to find out the relative risk my wife be unwilling to take any significant risk in order to have nice surroundings

study Charles Jackman The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effect on the stratosphere involve three independent theoretical group and be organize by Dr Michael Prather NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies the three group involve Michael Prather and Maria Garcia NASA GISS Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc The effort be to look at the effect of the space shuttle and Titan rocket on the stratosphere the follow be the estimated source of stratospheric chlorine industrial source kilogram year natural source kilogram year Shuttle source kilogram year the shuttle source assume space shuttle and Titan rocket be launch yearly thus the launch would add less than to the total stratospheric chlorine source the effect on ozone be minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decrease by this be much less than total ozone variability associate with volcanic activity and solar flare the influence of human make chlorine product on ozone be compute by atmospheric model calculation to be a decrease in globally average ozone between and the influence of the space shuttle and Titan rocket on the stratosphere be negligible the launch schedule of the space Shuttle and Titan rocket would need to be increase by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as we increase in industrial halocarbon do at the present time theoretical result of this study have be publish in the space shuttle s impact on the Stratosphere MJ

example what look like a explosion be fuel burning after the external tank come apart the force on the crew cabin be not sufficient to kill the astronaut never mind destroy they body accord to the Kerwin team be medical forensic report the astronaut be kill when the more or less intact cabin hit the water at circa mph and they body then spend several week underwater they remains be recover and after the Kerwin team examine they they be send off to be bury USING the SHUTTLE beyond low earth orbit you can t use the shuttle orbiter for mission beyond low Earth orbit because it can t get there it be big and heavy and do not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tank furthermore it be not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight be thing like wing which be totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the Earth the shuttle orbiter be highly specialize for travel between Earth be surface and low orbit take it higher be enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystem to build a specialize high orbit spacecraft yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer the face on MARS there really be a big rock on Mars that look remarkably like a humanoid face it appear in two different frame of viking orbiter imagery a much more facelike in appearance and the one more often publish with the Sun degree above western horizon and a with the Sun degree from the west science writer Richard Hoagland have champion the idea that the Face be artificial intend to resemble a human and erect by a extraterrestrial civilization most other analyst concede that the resemblance be most likely accidental other viking image show a smiley face crater and a lava flow resemble Kermit the frog elsewhere on Mars there exist a Mars Anomalies Research Society sorry don t know the address to study the Face the Mars Observer mission will carry a extremely high resolution camera and better image of the

astronaut a we will assume you mean a NASA astronaut since it be probably impossible for a non russian to get into the cosmonaut corps pay passenger be not professional cosmonaut and the other nation have so few astronaut and fly even fewer that you be better off hope to win a lottery become a shuttle pilot require lot of fast jet experience which mean a military fly career forget that unless you want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission specialist if you aren t a US citizen become one that be a must after that the crucial thing to remember be that the demand for such job vastly exceed the supply NASA be problem be not find qualified people but thin the lineup down to manageable length it be not enough to be qualify you must avoid be dis qualify for any reason many of they in principle quite irrelevant to the job get a ph d specialize in something that involve get you hand dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer programming entirely it will be do from the ground for the fore seeable future degree s in one field plus work experience in another seem to be a frequent winner be in good physical condition with good eyesight DO NOT get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve you vision nobody know what sudden pressure change would do to rked eye and long term effect be poorly understand for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknown if you can pass a jet pilot physical you should be okay if you can t you chance be poor practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in appearance and action you have get a tough selling job ahead try to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you be better than hundred of other applicant and also that you will be a credit to NASA after you be

motivated people so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation keep try many astronaut didn t make it the first time NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lyndon B Johnson Space Center Houston Texas announcement for Mission Specialist and pilot astronaut candidate Astronaut Candidate Program The National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA have a need for pilot astronaut candidate and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates to support the space Shuttle Program NASA be now accept on a continuous basis and plan to select astronaut candidate as need person from both the civilian sector and the military service will be consider all position be located at the Lyndon b Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas and will involve a year training and evaluation program space Shuttle Program description the numerous successful flight of the space Shuttle have demonstrate that operation and experimental investigation in space be become routine the space Shuttle Orbiter be launch into and maneuver in the Earth orbit perform mission lastle up to day it then return to earth and be ready for another flight with payload and flight crew the Orbiter perform a variety of orbital mission include deployment and retrieval of satellite service of exist satellite operation of specialize laboratory astronomy earth science material process manufacturing and other operation these mission will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station the Orbiter also provide a staging capability for use higher orbit than can be achieve by the Orbiter itself user of the Space Shuttle be capability be both domestic and foreign and include government agency and private industry the crew normally consist of five people the commander the pilot and three mission specialist on occasion additional crew member be assign the commander pilot and mission specialist be NASA astronaut pilot astronaut pilot astronaut server as both space Shuttle commander and pilot during flight the commander have onboard responsibility for the vehicle crew mission success and safety in flight the pilot assist the commander in control and operate the vehicle in addition the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellite utilize the remote manipulator system in extra vehicular activity and other payload operation Mission Specialist Astronaut Mission specialist astronaut work with the commander and pilot have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operation in the area of crew activity plan consumable usage and experiment and payload operation Mission specialist be require to have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle system as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristic mission requirement and objective and support system and equipment for each of the experiment to be conduct on they assign mission Mission specialist will perform extra vehicular activity payload handling use the remote manipulator system and perform or assist in specific experimental operation Astronaut Candidate Program Basic Qualification requirement Applicants MUST meet the follow minimum requirement prior to submit a application

Archive name space intro last modify date frequently ask question on SCI SPACE SCI ASTRO INTRODUCTION this series of link message be periodically post to the usenet group sci space and sci astro in a attempt to provide good answer to frequently ask question and other reference material which be worth preserve if you have correction or answer to other frequently ask question that you would like include in this post send email to leech c unc edu Jon Leech if you don t want to see the FAQ add frequently ask question to you kill file for this group if you be not read this with a newsreader that can kill article by subject you be out of luck the faq volume be excessive right now and will hopefully be trim down by rewrite and condense over time the faq posting be available in the Ames SPACE archive in faq faq good summary will be accept in place of the answer give here the point of this be to circulate exist information and avoid rehash old answer better to build on top than start again nothing more depressing than rehash old topic for the th time reference be provide because they give more complete information than any short generalization question fall into three basic type where do I find some information about space try you local public library first the net be not a good place to ask for general information ask individual by email if you must there be other source use they too the net be a place for open end discussion I have a idea which would improve space flight Hope you aren t surprised but out of have usually be think of before Again contact a direct individual source for evaluation NASA field thousand of these each day miscellanous query these be address on a case by case basis in the follow series of FAQ posting SUGGESTIONS for BETTER NETIQUETTE Read news announce newuser if you be on Usenet Minimize cross reference do you really need to edit Subject line especially if you be take a tangent send mail instead avoid post follow up mail message worth post

respond to remove signature and header summarize put a return address in the body signature of you message mail or article state you institution etc Don t assume the reply function of mailer will work Use absolute date post in a timely way Don t post what everyone will get on tv anyway some editor and window system do character count line wrap keep line under character for those use ASCII terminal
