While the judges enjoyed the thin crust and flavorful "zesty" sauce of this pizza, it ultimately lost points for lack of freshness. Despite the fact that it was made while we waited (there were no "Hot-n-Ready" pizzas prepared), most judges felt it was very similar to frozen pizza. "Very processed look and flavorless dough, tastes very pre-fab," stated one judge.
