Italian purists might scoff at heaping such praise on a foreign-born topping and everyone else might yell at me for not ranking it number one, but pepperoni is number two because it perfectly represents the gluttonous side of pizza.No other vegetable offers quite the burst of flavor as a sun-dried tomato. I consider it an "event topping" that slows down the eating process and forces you to enjoy each bite, rather than just setting your teeth to autopilot and mindlessly making a slice disappear.
